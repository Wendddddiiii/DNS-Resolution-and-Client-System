# DNScraft: DNS Resolution and Client System

DNScraft is a DNS resolver developed in Python for domain name resolution, reverse DNS lookups, and message structure analysis. This project aims to provide a comprehensive DNS resolution system for various networking applications.

## Features

- **Domain Name Resolution:** DNScraft can resolve domain names to IP addresses using DNS queries.
- **Reverse DNS Lookups:** It supports reverse DNS lookups to map IP addresses to domain names.
- **Message Structure Analysis:** DNScraft can analyze the structure of DNS messages to understand their components.

## Performance Experiment

We conducted a performance experiment comparing DNScraft to public DNS services. The experiment involved resolving times and response data for 5000 domain names. The results demonstrated DNScraft's efficiency and reliability in resolving DNS queries.
